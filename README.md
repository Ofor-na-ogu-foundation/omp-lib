 ## MPA FUNCTIONS
    * build(..MPA_*):  rebuilds the transaction for a given and spits outs the rawtx.
    * validate(MPA_*): validate that a marketplace action conforms to the protocol.
    * verify(..MPA_*): verifies a _chain_ of MarketPlaceActions.
    * strip(MPA_*):  strip any fields that do not belong in the protocol (simple: delete all that start with "_").

    * create(MPA_LISTING): returns MPA_BID.
    * accept(MPA_LISTING, MPA_BID): returns MPA_ACCEPT.
    * lock(MPA_LISTING, MPA_BID, MPA_ACCEPT): make this also create the release tx. returns MPA_LOCK.
    * release(MPA_LISTING, MPA_BID, MPA_ACCEPT, MPA_LOCK): returns MPA_RELEASE.

## Deterministic transaction generation

Given a sequence of MPA's (marketplace actions), the resulting transaction generated by this library should be identical, byte-for-byte.

## Private fields
Additional fields can be supplied by the database with an "_", these should be stripped out using strip().
We should only use these if there's seriously a need for them.
