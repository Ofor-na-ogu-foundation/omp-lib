 ## MPA FUNCTIONS
    * build(..MPA_*):  rebuilds the transaction for a given and spits outs the rawtx.
    * validate(MPA_*): validate that a marketplace action conforms to the protocol.
    * verify(..MPA_*): verifies a _chain_ of MarketPlaceActions.
    * strip(MPA_*):  strip any fields that do not belong in the protocol (simple: delete all that start with "_").

    * create(MPA_LISTING_ADD): returns MPA_BID.
    * accept(MPA_LISTING_ADD, MPA_BID): returns MPA_ACCEPT.
    * lock(MPA_LISTING_ADD, MPA_BID, MPA_ACCEPT): make this also create the release tx. returns MPA_LOCK.
    * release(MPA_LISTING_ADD, MPA_BID, MPA_ACCEPT, MPA_LOCK): returns MPA_RELEASE.

## Format validators
The format validators can be found in the `src/format-validators` directory.
These purely validate:
* required fields
* the right types (string, number, ..)
* non-negative fields

## Sequence verifiers
The sequence verifiers can be found in the `src/sequence-verifiers` directory.
These purely verify that the provide sequence of actions is correct:
* validate format of action first
* check the sequence to verify that the order is correct (e.g. no bids before listing)
* verify that the sequence linked by the hashes is correct
* verify that the cryptocurrency in the bid is allowed in the listing
* verify that the escrow type over the sequence doesn't change

## Deterministic transaction generation

Given a sequence of MPA's (marketplace actions), the resulting transaction generated by this library should be identical, byte-for-byte. The library rebuilds the transactions and does store a state of (incomplete) transactions.

## Private fields
Additional fields can be supplied by the database with an "_", these should be stripped out using strip().
We only use these when building transactions.
